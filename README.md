## Intentions of this Book and Web Course

  - To train the next-generation of scientists to work with data - regardless of the type, format, or volume.
  - Make available a set of open-source materials to learn how to engage in reproducible science, leveraging code-based techniques.
  - This repository is intended to house various sample workflows, and code snippets, to support research + data science activities.

## Background

A reproducibility crisis (Ioannidis, 2005; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) has emerged as a threat to the scientific
enterprise. Over the last decade I've engaged in learning opportunities to become proficient across topics including
data wrangling and modeling of text, image, video, and eye-tracking data, as well as more recently sensor data, and
look forward to training the next generation of scientists on code-based methods to apply in their research.
